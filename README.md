# Naive Bayes Implementation From Scratch
Note: This project is modified from the assignment 1 of COMP30027 Machine Learning at the University of Melbourne.

## Introduction:
Human pose recognition is one of important tasks for AI systems that interact with people. With the use of neural networks, keypoints have been identified corresponding to the main parts of the body. The focus of this project is on implementing Naive Bayes classifier from scratch to recognize pose based on the positions of these body parts.

## Data
The data is drawn from a yoga pose classification dataset created by Anastasia Marchenkova and released online here. The pose keypoints were produced by a computer vision algorithm based on OpenPose. The algorithm identifies 11 keypoints on the body and returns their x and y values. The data is provided as a csv file; the first column is the name of the yoga pose and the remaining columns are the keypoints (11 x values followed by 11 y values). Since the keypoint data was generated by a computer vision algorithm, it may contain some errors. Some instances have missing keypoints because a part of the body was not visible in the original image or the algorithm failed to detect it. Missing keypoints have x and y values of 9999.

## Training
In the training phase, the prior probabilities for each class, and the likelihoods P(xi|cj) for each attribute xi in each class cj have to be calculated. Two parameters (mean and standard deviation) are required to define the Gaussian distribution for each attribute Ã— class. 
Multiplying many probabilities in the range (0, 1] can result in very low values and lead to underflow (numbers smaller than the computer can represent). Hence, when implementing the naive Bayes model, the log() of each probability is taken and we sum them instead of multiplying. 

## Testing
In the testing phase, the trained model is used to classify unseen data. The predicted class for each instance is obtained based on the Bayes rule as shown above.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of Naive Bayes, macro-averaging and micro-averaging are implemented in the evaluation function to compute precision and recall. The results using macro-averaging is 0.719 for precision and 0.737 for recall. The results using micro-averaging is 0.741 for precision and 0.741 for recall.
